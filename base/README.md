### Base Classes for different Projects
This repository contains some useful functions that can be used for different projects.
The folder `base` contains some basic scripts with functions, while `classes` contains classes with useful functions and which should be easier to use in scripts.
To initialize a subclass of the base classes in `classes`, do
```
python init_subclass.py /target/path/for/subclass [path/to/classes/to/initialize]
```
Note that arguments in `[]` are optional. If no arguments are given, subclasses for all classes in `classes` are initialized.
You can add process-specific new functions to your subclasses. Feel free to contribute to the base classes if you feel that your implementation could be usefull for other projects!
